<H3>Kiselman type semigroups (Volodymyr Mazorchuk, NBSAN York, 24th November 2010)</H3>

<P><STRONG>Abstract:</STRONG>
Kiselman semigroups form a class of finite semigroups
with origins in convexity theory. In this talk I plan to define
a generalization, called Kiselman type semigroups, which are
finitely presentable semigroups associated with simple mixed
graphs. Examples include both Kiselman semigroups, 0-Hecke
monoids and various mixtures. I will try to describe both
their combinatorial properties and various representations.
This is a joint work with O.Ganyushkin and G.Kudryavtseva.</P>
