<H3>Structure theorems for proper restriction semigroups (Claire Cornock, NBSAN York, 25th November 2009)</H3>

<P><STRONG>Abstract:</STRONG>
Following on from McAlister's P-theorem for proper inverse semigroups,  we
consider P-theorems for proper restriction semigroups.  One-sided
restriction semigroups arise in the work of a number of authors;
structure theorems exist for proper left restriction semigroups (and
special subclasses) analogous to those of McAlister for proper inverse
semigroups.</P>

<P>We use the one sided results to produce two sided results that are
left-right symmetric, motivated by the idea of a double action of a  monoid
on a semilattice. Imposing further conditions on the monoid we  then obtain
symmetrical structure theorems for proper weakly ample and  proper ample
semigroups.</P>
