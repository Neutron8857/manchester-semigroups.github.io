<H3>Word problems of free inverse monoidsEquations over hyperbolic groups and semigroups (Tara Brough, NBSAN York, 18th January 2017)</H3>

<P><STRONG>Abstract:</STRONG>
The word problem of the free inverse monoid on a finite set $X$ is
context-sensitive (recognisable in linear time), but not context-free.
There is a rich world of interesting language classes in between the
context-free and context-sensitive, and I will discuss where the free
inverse monoid word problem fits in that world.</P>
