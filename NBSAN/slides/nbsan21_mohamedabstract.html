<H3>Isomorphisms amongst cyclically presented groups (Esamaldeen Mohamed, NBSAN Essex, 10th July 2015)</H3>

<P><STRONG>Abstract:</STRONG>
We consider a class of cyclically presented groups that are a
generalization of the Fibonacci groups. Different choices of the defining
parameters can give isomorphic groups.
We discuss different techniques for proving two cyclically presented groups
are isomorphic, and for proving two cyclically presented groups are
non-isomorphic.
This allows bounds on the number of non-isomorphic groups to be obtained for
any given number of generators.
