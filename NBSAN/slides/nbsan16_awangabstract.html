<H3>Semigroups, Cayley graphs and finite presentations (Jenni Awang, NBSAN York, 20th November 2013)</H3>

<P><STRONG>Abstract:</STRONG>
A Cayley graph of a semigroup can be used to try and glean
interesting information about the semigroup it represents.  One of the
properties we are interested in is finite presentability, and whether this
is preserved by having similar Cayley graphs.  We answer this question, and
give a few other examples of interesting properties.</BODY>
