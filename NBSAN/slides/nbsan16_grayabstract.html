<H3>Ideals and finiteness conditions for subsemigroups (Robert Gray, NBSAN York, 20th November 2013)</H3>

<P><STRONG>Abstract:</STRONG>
Significant information about a semigroup may be obtained by
studying its ideal structure and various finiteness conditions related to
it. Examples include the existence of minimal ideals, stability and the
property of Green's relations J and D coinciding. Such properties have
been identified and investigated because of their usefulness in the study
of finite semigroups. This has led to instances where theorems that
were originally proved for finite semigroups have been extended to apply to
wider classes. I will talk about infinite semigroups satisfying such
finiteness properties relating to their ideal structure, and present some
results about the preservation of such properties when passing to
subsemigroups and extensions. The results I will present are joint work
with V. Maltcev, J. D. Mitchell and N. Ruskuc.
