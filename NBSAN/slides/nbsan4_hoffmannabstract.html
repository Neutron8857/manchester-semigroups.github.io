<H3>Hyperbolic monoids (Michael Hoffmann, NBSAN York, 25th November 2009)</H3>

<P><STRONG>Abstract:</STRONG>
The notion of hyperbolicity is very significant in groups. Extending the
notion to semigroup is interesting and challenging.
Capturing a geometric property in terms of formal language theory has been
proven to be very successful in the context of automatic groups and
semigroups.
Robert Gilman and Andrew Duncan  used a push down automata to give an
elegant 'formal language' definition of hyperbolic groups which naturally
extends to semigroups.</P>

<P>This new class of semigroups seams to not share the computational properties
of hyperbolic groups.</P>

<P>In this talk we will look at the different classes stemming from Gilman and
Duncans idea, their relationship to other classes of semigroups with a
special emphasis of computational properties.</P>
