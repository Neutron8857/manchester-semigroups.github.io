<H3>Endomorphisms of semigroups: growth and interactions with subsemigroups (Alan Cain, NBSAN York, 20th November 2013)</H3>

<P><STRONG>Abstract:</STRONG>
The growth of an endomorphism of a semigroup is (informally) a
measure
of how much a ball in the Cayley graph can be stretched by an
endomorphism, taking the limit as the radius of the ball goes to
infinity. I will introduce the concept and survey some of its
properties. In particular, for any real number r \geq 1, there is an
endomorphism whose growth is r. On the other hand, the growth rate of
an endomorphism of a semigroup with a homogeneous presentation must be
an algebraic number. I will also describe how the growth of an
endomorphism can be connected (or not connected) to subsemigroups that
it respects.(This is joint work with Victor Maltcev.)
