<H3>Adequate transversals of abundant semigroups (Jim Renshaw, NBSAN York, 25th November 2009)</H3>

<P><STRONG>Abstract:</STRONG>
Inverse transversals of regular semigroups were introduced by Blyth &
McAlister in the late 70's in connection with their study  of split orthodox
semigroups. El-Qallali subsequently generalised the notion to adequate
subsemigroups of abundant semigroups and it is this generalisation that I
will discuss in this talk. After summarising some of the known results for
adequate transversals, I will detail some recent joint work (with Jehan
Al-Bar) on the structure of transversals where the abundant semigroup is in
fact quasi-adequate and where the structure is based on a spined product of
left and right adequate semigroups.
