<STRONG>Abstract.</STRONG>
Thompson's group \(V\) was the first known example of a finitely generated
infinite simple group. It is also a natural infinite analogue of the
finite symmetric groups, the topological full group of the one-sided
shift, the automorphism group of the J&oacute;nsson-Tarski algebra with 2 unary
operations and is in some sense the symmetry group of associativity and
commutativity. As a result, this group has received a lot of attention
over the past 60 years of research. In this talk I discuss the monoids
which play the same four roles as \(V\) except from the perspectives of
partial transformations, transformations, and partial bijections (where \(V\)
itself corresponds to bijections). In particular, I discuss their
generation, presentation, and simplicity. Joint work with Reinis Cirpons,
Alex Levine, and James Mitchell.

<STRONG>Abstract.</STRONG>
Left adequate monoids generalise the well-studied class of inverse
monoids, with a graphical description of free structures given by
Kambites. It is natural then to consider graphical interpretations of
presentations, akin to work by Munn and Stephen for inverse monoids. In
general, we believe this to be very hard; left adequate monoids do not
seem to play well with presentations (they do not form a variety, for
example). Here, we take tentative steps towards understanding specific
presentations, namely ones resembling the famed Margolis-Meakin
expansions. We introduce and study an interesting class of monoids,
defined by natural combination operations on birooted, edge-labelled
directed graphs, and show that they are examples of left adequate monoids
with such presentations. We term the resulting monoids pretzel monoids,
due to a resemblance between the diagrams we use to represent their
elements and certain baked goods... We construct each monoid from a right
cancellative monoid \(C\) and, with this viewpoint, one may understand pretzel
monoids as a left adequate analogue of the \(E\)-unitary Margolis-Meakin
expansions. This is joint work with Mark Kambites and N&oacute;ra Szak&aacute;cs.

<STRONG>Abstract.</STRONG>
Stemming from research on presentations for classical transformation semigroups \(T_n\), \(I_n\), and \(PT_n\), there have been interesting results on presentations for their
subsemigroups. Examples include the smallest presentations for the subsemigroups that contain \(S_n\), and presentations for proper ideals such as \(I_n \setminus S_n\), and
\(T_n \setminus S_n\). The
\(\mathcal{J}\)-classes of these semigroups form a chain, and the relations in these presentations lie in some specific \(\mathcal{J}\)-classes. We are interested in the
minimal \(\mathcal{J}\)-class, J, whose
elements are involved in the presentations, and we use 'depth' to describe the position of J within the chain. In this talk, I will present results on the relational
depth of some semigroups with chain-like \(\mathcal{J}\)-classes.

<STRONG>Abstract.</STRONG>
Each "plactic-like" monoids is defined by some algorithm which takes a 
word and outputs a combinatorial object. The stalactic monoid and taiga 
monoid are two such plactic-like monoids, corresponding the stalactic 
tableaus and binary search trees with multiplicity respectively. In this 
talk, I introduce two new plactic-like monoids, the meet-stalactic 
monoid and the meet-taiga monoid. These monoids are defined by running 
their respective algorithm in both directions on a word producing two 
combinatorial objects.  After introducing these monoids, I will present 
a number of results about these monoids, including a 
Robinson-Schensted-like Theorem. This is joint work with Duarte Ribeiro.

<STRONG>Abstract.</STRONG>
Direct products and congruences are basic building blocks for semigroup 
theory, so it is natural to ask what are the congruences for a direct 
product. In fact, congruences themselves are subsemigroups of direct 
products. One construction for subsemigroups of direct products is fibre 
products, so one family of congruences on a direct product may be obtained 
as fibre products of congruences on the factors. For simple monoids this 
approach describes all the congruences. As a consequence it is possible 
classify when every congruence on a direct product decomposes as a 
product of congruences on the factors. One natural question asks what is 
the maximum length of a chain of congruences? Generalising the fibre 
congruence construction to describe congruences on simple actions allows 
us to answer this question for direct products, in terms of the maximum 
lengths of chains of congruences on the factors.

I will give an update on an ongoing project I first talked about at the 
12th NBSAN meeting in 2012. I have been trying to determine the extent 
to which the class of automaton semigroups is closed under various 
standard semigroup constructions, with a special focus on the free 
product.  In recent work with Jan Philipp W&auml;chter and Janette Welker, we 
not only substantially improved on my previous free product results with 
Alan Cain, but also observed that our constructions all work for 
self-similar semigroups. I will give a brief introduction to 
self-similarity, describe the evolution of my understanding of free 
products of automaton and self-similar semigroups, with a sketch of the 
proof of our latest result, and discuss where to go from here.

<STRONG>Abstract.</STRONG>
Motivated by the arguably most elusive open problem in combinatorial algebra - the question of decidability of the word problem for one-relator monoids, 
standing unresolved for almost a century - the past few decades have seen a development of a rich theory showcasing intricate and deep connections between 
decision problems for finitely presented monoids, inverse monoids, and groups. Among those problems we may single out the submonoid membership problem, 
more generally, the rational subset membership problem, or, more specifically, membership problems for some particular submonoids such as the prefix monoid 
(of a finitely presented group) or the monoid of right units (of a finitely presented special inverse monoid). This talk will present recent results in 
this vein obtained in collaboration with Robert Gray (University of East Anglia), and is, in a broad sense, related to Gray's Morning Talk at the BMC. We 
obtained a full characterisation of prefix monoids of finitely presented groups, as well as some further information on these monoids, such as the groups 
of units and Sch&uuml;tzenberger groups. Much less is known about the monoids right units of finitely presented special inverse monoids, although some partial 
information is available. In particular, the universality result for the Sch&uuml;tzenberger groups does still hold true. I will present selected results of 
ongoing research in this direction, as well a number of open questions.

( <button class="abstract-toggle">abstract</button>
    )
        <div class="abstract" style="display: none;">
<STRONG>Abstract.</STRONG>
A congruence on an inverse semigroup is called idempotent-pure if it never relates an idempotent to a non-idempotent. These congruences preserve much more 
of the structure of the semigroup than most congruences do. The well-known class of E-unitary inverse semigroups is rich in structure because they are 
precisely the inverse semigroups with a group idempotent-pure quotient.<BR><BR>

Dually to this, it is thus natural when studying more general inverse semigroups to focus on the class of inverse semigroups which have "already been 
quotiented by all of their idempotent-pure congruences". This is precisely the class of E-disjunctive inverse semigroups. I will introduce E-disjunctive 
inverse semigroups and speak about the above structure preservation in more detail. This exploration is based on some recent work done with my 
collaborators Alex Levine and James Mitchell.

My talk will explore the relationship between free profinite semigroups and symbolic dynamics, a line of research which goes back to the work of Almeida in 
the early 2000s. I will start by presenting Almeida's fundamental theorem, which gives a bijection between minimal shift spaces (a central object of 
symbolic dynamics) and maximal regular J-classes of free profinite semigroups. I will then survey a number of interesting features of this bijection from 
the point of view of semigroup theory, and discuss interesting applications from the point of view of symbolic dynamics.

<STRONG>Abstract.</STRONG>
We generalize the duality between Boolean right restriction monoids and ample source-etale categories by Cockett and Garner to the non-unital and locally 
compact setting. Our approach upgrades the widely known construction of the tight groupoid of an inverse semigroup as the groupoid of germs. Elements of a 
supported Boolean right restriction semigroup are represented by right compact slices of their attached right ample categories. In these categories, the 
domain map is a local homeomorphism, but the range map is not even open in general, so that ranges of elements of the category are not 'seen' in the 
attached right restriction semigroup. In the special case where the range map of the right ample category is open, the right restriction semigroup has the 
additional structure of a left Ehresmann semigroup. Specializing further to the case where the range map of the category is a local homeomorphism, the 
category has the additional property that every compact right slice is a finite join of compact two-sided slices. On the algebraic side, this brings 
Boolean right restriction Ehresmann semigroups with the extra property that every element is a finite join of deterministic elements. These semigroups are 
a natural generalization of Garner's groupoidal right restriction monoids.

<STRONG>Abstract.</STRONG>
This talk delves into the intricate world of quasi-crystals, an extension of the well-established theory of crystal bases in representation theory. Originating from the groundbreaking work of Drinfeld, Jimbo, and Kashiwara in the 1980s, quantum groups and crystal bases have played a pivotal role in theoretical physics and various mathematical domains. Kashiwara's development of crystal bases and crystal graphs provided a framework for studying representations of quantum groups, revealing intriguing connections with Young tableaux and the plactic monoid.<BR><BR>

The plactic monoid, central to the theory of symmetric polynomials and the Littlewood-Richardson rule, bridges the gap between crystal structures and Schur polynomials. In parallel, the hypoplactic monoid enters the scene in the realm of quasi-symmetric functions, offering an analogue to the classical plactic monoid with applications in quasi-ribbon tableaux.<BR><BR>

Building on the quasi-crystal structure introduced with Alan Cain, this talk explores the extension of crystal concepts to quasi-crystals. We present a set of local axioms for quasi-crystal graphs of simply-laced root systems, drawing parallels with Stembridge's work on crystals. The characterization of quasi-crystal graphs arising from the quasi-crystal of type An answers an open question, providing insight into the local structural properties that define these structures.

<STRONG>Abstract.</STRONG>
With the monoid of all order-preserving functions on an \(n\)-set, we associate a category with partial composition - a category in which the composition 
of two morphisms might be undefined even if the range of the first equals the domain of the second. We will show that the algebra of the monoid is 
isomorphic to the algebra of the category over any commutative unital ring. Similar results have been useful in the study of algebras of many other finite 
semigroups: inverse semigroups, the monoid of partial functions, the Catalan monoid etc.<BR><BR>

More generally, with every reduced E-Fountain semigroup which satisfies the generalized right ample condition we will show how to associate a category with 
partial composition. Under some assumptions, we will prove an isomorphism of algebras between the semigroup algebra and the category algebra.<BR><BR>

This is a simultaneous generalization of a former result on reduced E-Fountain semigroups which satisfy the congruence condition, a result of Junying Guo 
and Xiaojiang Guo on strict right ample semigroups and a result of Benjamin Steinberg on idempotent semigroups with central idempotents.<BR><BR>

If time allows, we will discuss additional examples.

<LI>Tim Stokes - <EM>Can constellations shed light on semigroups?</EM>

( <button class="abstract-toggle">abstract</button>
    | <A HREF="slides/nbsan36_stokes.pdf">slides</A></a> )
        <div class="abstract" style="display: none;">
<STRONG>Abstract.</STRONG>
A constellation is a partial algebra that is a one-sided generalised category, with each element \(s\) having a domain \(D(s)\) but no range in general.  They 
model composition of functions (or morphisms) \(f\circ g\) where the image of \(f\) is contained (as a substructure) in the domain of \(g\), and codomains play 
no role.<BR><BR>

Constellations were developed by Gould and Hollings as a tool in semigroup theory for finding a category-like counterpart of left restriction semigroups.  
Those constellations corresponding to left restriction semigroups are called inductive, by analogy with the ordered groupoid/inverse semigroup case.<BR><BR>

General constellations have proved of interest for their own sake.  A process of right canonical extension of a constellation (which puts back in the 
missing codomains!) gives a category, leading to novel ways to think about the familiar concrete categories of mathematics.<BR><BR>

We shall explain how one can use a left-sided version of the canonical extension idea to obtain constellations from monoids.  If the constellation is 
inductive, one obtains a left restriction monoid.  This leads to new ways to build some familiar left restriction monoids from their subsemigroups of 
elements of domain \(1\).  The left restriction monoid of partial functions on a set \(X\) can be obtained in this way from the transformation monoid on \(X\).  
Other examples arise from the theories of binary relations and partitions.

<STRONG>Abstract.</STRONG>
We will discuss the decidability and complexity of the most important decision 
problems for semigroups and groups generated by finite-state, letter-to-letter 
transducers (which are usually simply referred to as "automata" in this 
context). In such an automaton, every state induces a function mapping input 
to output words. The closure of these functions under composition is the 
generated semigroup. If the automaton has additional properties (such as being 
complete and/or invertible), we obtain groups and inverse semigroups. The 
study of these objects is motivated by some groups with exotic properties that 
can be found in this class (where Grigorchuk's group is usually considered to 
be the most prominent one).
In the talk, we will recall the basic definitions and mainly give an overview 
of the most important results with regard to decision problems and also 
discuss some recent developments.

<STRONG>Abstract.</STRONG>
To every finite oriented graph \(\Theta\) with \(n\) vertices one
can associate a finitely presented monoid \(HK_{\Theta}\), called
the Hecke--Kiselman monoid. It is a monoid generated by \(n\)
idempotents with relations of the form \(xy=yx\) or
\(xyx=yxy=xy\), depending on the edges between vertices \(x\) and \(y\)
in \(\Theta\). By the Hecke-Kiselman algebra we mean the monoid algebra
\(K[HK_{\Theta}]\) of the monoid \(HK_{\Theta}\) over a field \(K\). We investigate the combinatorics and structure of the Hecke-Kiselman monoids and
algebras. It turns out that the case of the monoid \(C_n\) associated to an oriented cycle of length \(n\geqslant 3\) plays a crucial role. 
The unexpected chain of ideals inside \(C_n\) is constructed. 
This result is then applied to show that the monoid \(C_n\) satisfies a semigroup identity
and the associated algebra is a semiprime Noetherian algebra. As a consequence, 
we characterise all Hecke-Kiselman monoids that satisfy a semigroup identity. 
Moreover, the Jacobson radical of all Hecke-Kiselman algebras satisfying
a polynomial identity is described.

<STRONG>Abstract.</STRONG>
Since it is possible to represent Clifford semigroups as functors \(\mathrm{L} \to \mathrm{Grp}\),
it is natural to ask if semigroup homomorphisms between them can be
conceptualised in terms of maps between their associated functors.  Phrased
more precisely, is there a category whose objects are the functors so
described and which is equivalent to the category of Clifford semigroups?
While this problem has been solved, we argue in this talk that there is a
more principled categorical approach that leads directly to the solution,
involving the notion of a fibration.  The advantage of this approach is
that it brings along for the ride a number of interesting structures.  For
instance, this fibration may be exploited to gain a greater understanding
of the morphisms between Clifford semigroups.  In particular, each
orthogonal factorisation system on the codomain lifts to an orthogonal
factorisation system on the domain category.  We are able to conclude that
every homomorphism between Clifford semigroups can be factored as a
`surjective cartesian map' followed by an `idempotent-fixing injection'.
This restricts easily to the subcategory of commutative inverse semigroups.

In the 1960's Higman was able to characterize the finitely generated subgroups of finitely presented groups.  His result, which is called the Higman
Embedding Theorem, is a key result in combinatorial group theory which makes precise the connection between group presentations and logic.  In this talk I
will present some results of a similar flavour, proved in recent joint work with Mark Kambites (Manchester), in which we characterise the maximal
subgroups of inverse monoids defined by presentations where all the defining relators are of the form \(w=1\).  I will explain the motivation for studying
this class of inverse monoids, and also indicate how we established these results by developing new geometric approaches to maximal subgroups, exploiting
the fact that they are isomorphic to automorphism groups of Schutzenberger graphs.  I will also say something about some related recent joint work with
Igor Dolinka (Novi Sad) on, so-called, prefix monoids and their connection with the class of recursively presented group-embeddable monoids.

Abstract: In 1975, Boris Schein proved that free inverse semigroups are not
finitely presentable as semigroups.  In particular, he showed that the free
monogenic inverse semigroup is not finitely presentable using two
particular partial transformations.  Motivated by this result, I will give
a proof that a subsemigroup (not necessarily inverse) of the free monogenic
inverse semigroup is finitely presented if and only if it contains only
finitely many idempotents.  This is joint work with Nik Ru&scaron;kuc.

A group is multiple context-free, if its word problem is a multiple
context-free language (MCFL).  MCFLs sit between the class of context-free
languages and context sensitive languages.  By a theorem of Muller and
Schupp a group is context-free if and only if it is virtually free.  In
2015 Salvati showed that \(\mathbb{Z}^2\) is a multiple context-free group.  From there,
Ho has shown that all virtually abelian groups are in this class.  It would
be of interest to have a classification similar to that of Muller and
Schupp.  I will discuss one step of this, namely showing that this class is
closed under free products.  I will mostly focus on proving this result for
context-free languages using pushdown automata and discuss the
modifications and automata needed for the multiple context-free case.  This
is joint work with Davide Spriano.

<STRONG>Abstract.</STRONG>
A class of finite groups \(\mathcal{F}\) closed under quotients and finitary subdirect products is said to be a formation of finite groups. A class of finite groups \(\mathcal{C}\) 
closed under subnormal subgroups and for groups generated by two normal subgroups which are in \(\mathcal{C}\) is said to be a Fitting class of finite groups. A natural question that
arises is whether there are corresponding concepts for congruences and languages. This question has been addressed for formations of groups, of monoids and of many-sorted algebras,
and bijections between formations of semigroups, of congruences on the associated free object and of languages have been obtained. In this talk, based on recent join work with G.
Gomes, I will show that there exist bijections between formations of inverse semigroups, formations of congruences on inverse semigroups, and formations of congruences on free inverse
semigroups. Further, I will prove the existence of bijections between i-formations of inverse semigroups, of (idempotent separating) congruences and languages (contained in the
centraliser of the semigroup). This study appears in "<em>Formations and i-Fitting classes of inverse semigroups, congruences and languages</em>", and it was motivated by those
developed in "<em>Formations of inverse semigroups</em>" and "<em>Formations of Orthodox Semigroups</em>", where formations associated to idempotent-separating congruences play an
essential role. Based on these results, and with Fitting classes being the dual concept of formations, it is natural to look for similar results to those obtained for formations. I
will prove the existence of bijections between i-Fitting classes of Clifford semigroups, of (idempotent separating) congruences, and of languages (contained in the centralizer).

It was shown by Howie that a semigroup amalgam \( (S;T_1,T_2) \) does not embed if \( T_1 \) and \( T_2\) are both groups but \( S \) is not a group. Generalizing this result, Rahkema
and Sohail showed that \((S;T_1,T_2)\) is non-embeddable if \(T_1\) and \(T_2\) are completely regular (respectively, Clifford) semigroups but \(S\) is not completely regular
(respectively, Clifford). In this talk we shall consider the amalgams \( (S;T_1,T_2) \) such that \(T_1\) and \( T_2 \) are inverse semigroups while S is non-inverse but ample.

<STRONG>Abstract.</STRONG>
A semigroup \( S \) is said to be (right) pseudo-finite if the universal right congruence \( \omega_S:= S\times S \) can be generated by a finite set \( U\subseteq S\times S \), and there is a bound on the length of derivations for an arbitrary pair \( (s,t)\in S\times S \) as a consequence of those in \( U \).  The diameter of a
pseudo-finite semigroup is the smallest such bound taken over all finite generating sets. 
The notion of being pseudo-finite was introduced by White in the language of ancestry,  motivated by a conjecture of Dales and &Zdot;elazko for  Banach algebras. 
 The property also arises from a number of other  sources.

<BR><BR>

Pseudo-finiteness is  a very unpredictable condition. In the presence of cancellativity, e.g. for a group, it forces finiteness and, consequently, diameter 1. Any monoid with zero is easily seen to be  pseudo-finite with diameter at most 2. Rather trivially, both kinds of examples have minimal ideals. Further, any full transformation monoid \( \mathcal{T}_X \) (for any cardinality of \( X \) ) is pseudo-finite with diameter 1,  and has a  minimal ideal \( I \) of constant maps on which \( \mathcal{T}_X \)  acts with a high degree of transitivity.

<BR><BR>

The talk introduces the curious world of pseudo-finite semigroups. It has two focusses: exploring  the existence and nature of a minimal ideal in a pseudo-finite semigroup, and the size of the diameter.  Actions, presentations, Rees matrix constructions and some good old-fashioned semigroup tools will all play a part. 
  This research sits in the wider framework of a study of finitary conditions for semigroups.

We define an algebraic structure  similar to that of a semiring, but  without some of the requirements. As it is somehow also similar to

	We present a connection between Garside monoids and more generally lcm-monoids with  this  algebraic structure.
An  lcm-monoid  \( M \)  is a left-cancellative  monoid  such that \( 1 \) is the unique invertible element in \( M \),   and every pair of elements in \( M \) admit an lcm  with respect to left-divisibility.  The class of lcm-monoids contains the  Gaussian, quasi-Garside and Garside monoids.

 In this talk we examine how taking a variant affects the degree of \( S \), where for a fixed element \( a\in S \), the <EM>variant</EM> of \( S \) is the semigroup \( S^a=(S,\star) \) with sandwich product \( x\star y = xay \). By finding the degrees of   null semigroups and
   right null semigroups (right zero semigroups of null semigroups), we  are able to answer two questions of J. East from  "Transformation Representations of Sandwich Semigroups".  Namely, we show that it is possible to have \( \mu(S^a)< \mu(S) \) and deg \( (\mathcal{T}_n^\alpha) < 2n - \mathrm{rank}(\alpha) \).

<STRONG>Abstract.</STRONG>

In combinatorics and algebra morphisms are usually defined by preserving direct image: "A morphism between graphs (simplicial complexes) is a function that maps
edges to edges (faces to faces), for example.
<BR><BR>

But in topology, morphisms are defined by preservation of inverse image of designated subsets, the open or closed sets.
<BR><BR>

More generally, an incidence structure is a pair \(\mathcal{I}= (V,B) \) where \( V \) is a finite set and \( B \) is a collection of subsets of \( B \).
The incidence matrix \( M(\mathcal{I}) \) is the \( V \times B \) matrix over \( \{0,1\} \) that has a 1 in position \( (v,b) \)  if \( v \in b \) and \( 0 \) otherwise.
<BR><BR>

A partial function on \( V \) is called continuous if for each \( b \in B, bf^{-1} \in B \) whenever \( bf^{-1} \) is non-empty. Thus for the incidence structure
consisting of a topolgical space \( V \) and its collection Bof open sets, the monoid of total continuous functions are the continuous functions on \( V \) in the usual sense.
<BR><BR>

The monoid \( C(\mathcal{I}) \)  of continuous partial functions provides a link between combinatorics, discrete geometry and semigroup theory. It is easy to show that \( C(\mathcal{I}) \) is the translational hull of the 0-simple semigroup whose structure matrix is  \( M(\mathcal{I}) \). This gives geometric and combinatorial tools to study translational hulls and their subsemigroups.
<BR><BR>
We illustrate this straightforward idea in the cases of graphs, simplicial complexes, Steiner triple systems and pairwise balanced designs.

It was discovered very recently that many classes of rings can interestingly be defined in terms of chains of associate idempotents. The purpose of this talk is 
to explore such connections in the semigroup case. Precisely, we will study non-regular semigroups with the property that any two \( \mathcal{D} \)-related 
idempotents are related by a sequence of size \( n \) of alternatively \( \mathcal{L} \)- or \( \mathcal{R} \)- related idempotents. We will mainly focus on the
cases \( n=1, 2 \) and \( 3 \). In the particular case of \( n=2 \), we obtain a semilattice decomposition in terms of extensions of completely simple semigroups by poor semigroups.

        <div class="abstract" style="display: none;">
<STRONG>Abstract.</STRONG>
Language-theoretic methods in group theory have been used successfully to characterise many different algebraic properties, including virtual freeness and 
hyperbolicity. In the past 20 years, there has been an increased effort to explore such methods in semigroup theory. A staple method for constructing new 
semigroups and monoids from old is by taking free products. Free products are well known to interact well with context-free languages in groups - for example, 
Anisimov proved that the free product of two groups with context-free word problem is again context-free, and it is easy to show that free products of 
hyperbolic groups are hyperbolic. In this talk, I will give an overview of how free products of semigroups and monoids can interact with formal language theory 
in the context of the word problem and word-hyperbolicity. Many existing techniques for studying this require some fixed implementation of the context-free 
languages (e.g. push-down automata). The methods used here instead use closure properties of the classes of languages involved, yielding much more general 
results. For example, we recover and generalise a recent result of Brough, Cain and Pfeiffer that the class of context-free monoids are closed under free 
products. Furthermore, new purely group-theoretic results can be obtained, e.g.: the free product of two groups with ET0L word problem again has ET0L word 
problem.

<STRONG>Abstract.</STRONG> 
In early 1930s, Wilhelm Magnus proved his famous and celebrated  result that the word problem is decidable for all one-relator 
groups: given two group words \( u,v \) over the alphabet \( X \), there is an algorithm deciding whether \( u \) and \( v \) represent the
same element of the group given by a presentation of the form \( \langle X \mid w=1 \rangle \). This result is based on another important theorem 
proved earlier by Magnus, the <EM>Freiheitssatz</EM>, which, roughly speaking, locates many free subgroups in one-relator groups.
Later on, this inspired investigations of the word problem for other algebraic structures defined by a single relation. For example, 
in the 1960s Shirshov proved that the word problem is decidable for all one-relator Lie algebras. Surprisingly, the problem whether
the word problem is decidable for all one-relator monoids is still open (although several important cases have been resolved by 
Adjan in 1966, and Adyan and Oganessyan in 1987). <BR><BR>

An important intermediate class of algebraic structures lying between groups and monoids are that of inverse monoids. In 2001 
Ivanov, Margolis and Meakin highlighted the importance of investigating one-relator inverse monoids by showing that the (conjectured) 
decidability of the word problem for one-relator <EM>special</EM> inverse monoids (the ones defined by a relation of the form \( w=1 \)) 
would imply a positive solution of the word problem for all one-relator monoids. They also showed that, under a condition that is
very familiar within the inverse semigroup theory realm, in the <EM>\( E \)-unitary case</EM>, solving the word problem for the inverse
monoid \( M \) given by the presentation \( \langle X \mid w=1 \rangle \) is equivalent to solving the <EM>prefix membership problem</EM> for the group \( G \) 
given by the same presentation. This problem asks whether there exists an algorithm deciding whether a given word \( u \) represents 
an element of the submonoid \( P_w \) of \( G \) generated by all prefixes of the relator word \( w \). <BR><BR>

In this talk I will present several recent results, obtained in collaboration with Robert D. Gray (UEA Norwich), pertaining to the 
prefix membership problem for a class of one-relator groups -- and thus having implications for the word problem for special 
one-relator inverse monoids. These results will be formulated in terms of the classical constructions in combinatorial group theory:
amalgamated free products and HNN-extensions.<BR><BR>

Degree 2 Transformation Semigroups as Continuous Maps on
Graphs: Foundations and Structure</EM>

<STRONG>Abstract.</STRONG> 
We develop the theory of transformation semigroups that have degree 2, that
is,
act by partial functions on a finite set such that the inverse image of
each point has
at most two elements. We show that the graph of fibers of such an action
gives
a deep connection between semigroup theory and graph theory. It is known
that
the Krohn-Rhodes complexity of a degree 2 action is at most 2. We show that
the monoid of continuous maps on a graph is the translational hull of an
appropriate 0-simple semigroup. We show how group mapping semigroups can be
considered as regular covers of their right letter mapping image and
relate this to their graph of fibers.
This is joint work with John Rhodes.

        <div class="abstract" style="display: none;">
<STRONG>Abstract.</STRONG> A congruence on an inverse semigroup S is determined uniquely by its kernel
and trace. Denoting by \( \rho_k \) and \( \rho_t \) the least congruence on S
having the same kernel and the same trace as \( \rho \), respectively, and
denoting by \( \omega \) the universal congruence on S, we consider the sequence
\( \omega, \omega_k, \omega_t, (\omega_k)_t, (\omega_t)_k, \cdots \)<BR><BR>

We call these congruences, together with the inclusion relation for
congruences, the min network of congruences on S. The quotients
\( \{S/\omega_k\}, \{S/\omega_t\}, \{S/(\omega_k)_t\}, \{S/(\omega_t)_k\},
\cdots \), as S runs over all inverse semigroups, form quasivarieties.<BR><BR>

In this talk, I will talk about the repeated patterns in the resulting
quotient semigroups. These patterns help us not only determine the
quasivarieties to which the quotient semigroups belong, but also obtain
relationships among these quasivarieties. This is joint work with Li-Min
Wang, Lu Zhang, Hai-Yuan Huang and Zhi-Yong Zhou.<BR><BR>

By the Diophantine problem we mean the algorithmic problem of
determining if any given system of equations has a solution. Two classical
results due to Makanin (1977, 1983) show that the Diophantine problem is
decidable in any free monoid, and in any free group. It is natural to ask
to what extent these results can be extended to classes of monoids and
groups which are "close to being free", in some sense. In this talk I will
present some results from joint work with Albert Garreta (Bilbao) in which
we investigated this question for one-relator monoids.

        <div class="abstract" style="display: none;">

<STRONG>Abstract.</STRONG> 
The word problem for one-relator monoids is a longstanding open question.
Kobayashi asked in 2000 whether every one-relator monoid admits a finite
complete rewriting system. A necessary condition to have a finite complete
rewriting system is to satisfy the homological finiteness condition
\( FP_{\infty} \). Kobayashi also asked in 2000 whether every one-relator
monoid is of type \( FP_{\infty} \) and proved that each one-relator monoid
is of type \( FP_3 \).<BR><BR>

In this talk, we discuss our proof that every one-relator monoid is
indeed of type \( FP_{\infty} \). Our techniques combine methods from
algebraic topology (monoids acting on CW complexes), homological
algebra and the theory of monoid van Kampen diagrams.  This is joint
work with Bob Gray.<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Abstract.</STRONG> 
I will report on some joint work with Mark Kambites 
(<A HREF="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03991">https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03991</A>). We show that the plactic monoid of 
every finite rank has a faithful representation by upper triangular 
matrices over the tropical semiring. This answers a question first posed 
by Izhakian and subsequently studied by several authors. A consequence is 
a proof of a conjecture of Kubat and 
Okni&#324;ski that every plactic monoid of 
finite rank satisfies a non-trivial semigroup identity. In the converse 
direction, we show that every identity satisfied by the plactic monoid of 
rank \( n \) is satisfied by the monoid of \( n \times n \) upper triangular tropical 
matrices. In particular this implies that the variety generated by the
\( 3 \times 3 \) 
upper triangular tropical matrices coincides with that generated by the 
plactic monoid of rank \( 3 \).
